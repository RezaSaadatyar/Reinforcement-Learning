 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**<br/>
 RL is a type of artifcial intelligence (AI) method and provides an agent to discover the environment through trial-and-error.
 
 The Q-learning (QL) method is a branch of RL that improves the path besides reducing computational time.
 
**Exploration-Exploitation in Epsilon Greedy Algorithm:**<br/>
***Exploitation*** is when the agent knows all his options and chooses the best option based on the previous success rates. Whereas ***exploration*** is the concept where the agent is unaware of his opportunities and tries to explore other options to better predict and earn rewards.
